                    Immersive Engineering is a tech mod with a certain charm, based on the ideas and concepts, and
                    with most assets created by Damien Hazard.

                    Overall, it's about realism-inspired technology:
                    Instead of glowing red tubes, it offers actual, hanging powerlines.
                    Instead of one block that magically spits out dusts when ore is put in, it offers a crusher, a big
                    multiblock (5x3x3) that features rotating wheels and spits out particles as it breaks the ore.
                    Instead of a Laser that turns power into magical light and ores, it offers an Excavator, another
                    massive, resource intensive, multiblock (3x7x8) which digs ores out of the ground with a big
                    rotating bucketwheel.

                    IE is about making tech mods more balanced and more pretty, and adding its own twist by going for
                    retro-futurism (think BioShock, Order 1886, SkyCaptain and the World of Tomorrow) rather than
                    clinical white+grey future cubes.

                    Soartex is a smooth contemporary 64x art style for Minecraft. The textures, originally made by
                    Soar49, have been developed and updated by fans over the past three years. These textures are
                    carefully designed to be detailed, but not photo-realistic; organic, but not cartoony. There are two
                    official continuations of Soartex: Fanver and Invictus.

                    Fanver is a community continuation of Soartex, a texture pack by Soar49. Fans are encouraged to
                    contribute textures through the forum. These contributions are reviewed by graphic designers, who
                    make friendly recommendations and ultimately determine the content of updates. Fanver is known for
                    being faithful to the original work of Soar49, with as few alterations as possible.
